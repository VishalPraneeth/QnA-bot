Implement auto-scaling to add more servers when CPU utilization is more than 80% for 15 mins. Maximum number of servers could be 8. \n- Make use of CDN (CloudFront) to distribute the static content across the world. \n- Create different IAM users and groups - \n       + Group1: Have access to start/stop EC2 instances and reboot RDS instances. \n       + Group2: Have full rights on S3. Enable Detailed Cloudwatch monitoring and create Cloudwatch alarms on these instances and subscribe it to respective organization DLs. \n- Setup the VPC to achieve above use-case. In the created VPC, keep EC2 and RDS private. ELB would be public-facing.

Creation & Deletion\n10.How to architect a Highly available environment?\n11.What is the difference between #CloudTrail and #Config?\n12.What about scalability in case of RDS databases?\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nARCHITECTING CASE STUDY ----\n\nCustomer has given following problem. Create the solution for the customer with all AWS services and explain the advantages. \n\nCompany ABC is currently operating in USA for the past 10 years with all infrastructure in-house. They want to move their existing JAVA based website to Cloud now, as part of increasing traffic. Their HQ is located at New Jersey. They receive traffic from all over the world. They would want to make use of existing Microsoft Active Directory (on-prem) to validate their employees on the website. Also, they would want the solution to be flexible enough to handle weekend spikes in traffic. \n\nIn addition to this, they want to have an ETL server (Informatica) on cloud and the results of ETL should be shown on Tableau. These dashboards would be embedded on their website. Recommend a complete architecture for this RFP along with complete infrastructure details and pricing. Also, suggest the customer different pricing strategies to handle the DEV, TEST and PROD environment for the above setup on AWS. \n_______________________________________________________\n\nSysOps Case Study -----\n\nYour organization has got the final architecture for a new upcoming web solution. Read through the following and implement the same on AWS.\n\nThe web solution makes use of ASP.net and SQL Server. It also has lot of static assets e.g. images, audio, video etc. Region of choice is Oregon (US). Implement High-availability with auto-scaling. \nInstance types for Web-server to be m4.large with 200GB EBS SSD volumes. Under normal conditions, 4 servers are enough. Implement auto-scaling to add more servers when CPU utilization is more than 80% for 15 mins. Maximum number of servers could be 8. \nMake use of CDN (CloudFront) to distribute the static content across the world. Create different IAM users and groups - Group1: Have access to start/stop EC2 instances and reboot RDS instances. Group2: Have full rights on S3. \n\nEnable Detailed Cloudwatch monitoring and create Cloudwatch alarms on these instances and subscribe it to respective organization DLs. Setup the VPC to achieve above use-case. In the created VPC, keep EC2 and RDS private. ELB would be public-facing. Setup Security Groups and NACL as per best practices.",

Happy learning. \n\nERRATA below -- \n\n5:05 - Instances from other customers or shared instances (from you) can't sit on this physical host\n\n7:48 - You need to pay for the full physical host, as you are blocking the full host.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE May 2017: \n\nThere is a change which happened in May 2017 as I am able to find out. Please refer following links  to read further: \n\nhttp://cloudcheckr.com/2017/05/aws-hipaa-non-dedicated-instances/\n\nhttps://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf  (LAST PAGE of PDF)\n\nIn May 2017, AWS declared that your application could be HIPAA complied even when you run it on Shared instances (you don't necessarily need Dedicated instances anymore for HIPAA compliance). Post this, the other restriction has been dropped. Now, shared instances in your account can run on the host where your dedicated instance is running. \n\nEarlier the isolation was from 2 things: \n1. Instances of other AWS account \n2. Instances which are not dedicated instances.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would request to look at our playlists to learn systematically for AWS Certifications --- \nSolutions Architect - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywHFXfuJoSU&list=PLTyrc6mz8dg8YE7OpHYoaRILnf1RQM8bz    \n&&&     \nSysOps Administrator - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFSH-KuDGj8&list=PLTyrc6mz8dg8grU1HEhVw4zoCyvAl5MBO \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nI have answered lot of AWS Interview questions in LIVE sessions here -- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTyrc6mz8dg_tEexS22k_gmssDmkWkEMd \n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn to read interesting AWS updates & Practical Scenario Questions --- https://www.linkedin.com/in/knowledgeindia \n\nDon't miss any updates, please follow my FB page http://fb.me/AWStutorials   \n&   \nTwitter -  http://twitter.com/#!/knowledge_india \n\nAnd for AWS exercises & case-studies, you can refer our blog -- https://aws-tutorials.blogspot.com/ \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",
